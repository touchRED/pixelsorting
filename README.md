The code contained here was written for part of my Summer Fellowship with UGA's Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities. Made in collaboration with Mark Callahan of the Lamar Dodd School of Art and Ideas for Creative Exploration.

In order to build the app, import the code into the oF project generator and build.

Made with openFrameworks.
